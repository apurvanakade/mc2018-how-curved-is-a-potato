# How Curved Is a Potato?

I taught this class at Mathcamp 2018.
In this class, we discuss the curvatures of potatoes embedded in \\( \mathbb{R}^3\\) and systematically derive the notions of principal, Gaussian, and mean curvatures.
The prerequisites are linear algebra, in particular, the notions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
